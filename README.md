Proposal: Analysis of MIMIC-4
-----------------------------

### Introduction
Heart failure is a debilitating disease that effects about 6.2 million adults in the US every year, according to the CDC. While the risk factors for heart failure are known and have been extensively studied, the prevalence of known risk factors are evolving. Additionally, new medications and therapies are being introduced all the time. These changes mean that our understanding of what predicts heart failure may be changing as well. Wouldn't it be great to understand what are the *current* drivers of mortality in this population? 

### Dataset
This project uses MIMIC-IV. This is a retrospectively collected datasource containing ICU and EHR data. You can obtain more information on it here: physionet.org/content/mimiciv/0.4/.

You may need to request a DUA to access this data. Please contact me for the derived dataset used for this analysis. 

This analysis will be conducted in Rstudio, for which the script is contained in Analysis.R.

### Preliminary figures
Age, race and sex among heart failure ICU patients compared with all other ICU patients.


Using This Project
------------------
You will need Docker. You will need to be able to run docker as your current user.

	> docker build . -t project1-env
	> docker run -v 'pwd':/home/rstudio -p 8787:8787\
		 -e PASSWORD=<yourpassword> -t project1-env

Then connect to the mahcine on port 8787.

Makefile
--------
The Makefile included in this repository will help get a feel of the project. 

For example, to build figures relating to the distribution of ICU visits due to heart failure over race compaired to all ICU visits, enter via Docker or with Rstudio and say:

	> make figures/hfvicu_race_cmpr.png

Primary questions
-----------------
The primary question is to identify and characterize features predictive of mortality in heart failure patients. This will be conducted in two step: 
1) We will examine a variety of features (demographic information, medications, and lab results) to identify predictors of mortality in this patient poulation using logistic regression, LASSO, and Elastic Net.
2) We will characterize propensity scores for medications identified in the first step using logistic regression and Random forest. 


Completition criterion
----------------------
I want to fully understand the heart failure patients in this dataset and identify a preferred method to identify predictors and to calculate propensity scores.
