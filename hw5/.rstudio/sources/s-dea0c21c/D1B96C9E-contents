#Examine the dataset for any irregularities. 
#Make the case for filtering out a subset of rows (or for not doing so).
#Alignment data is missing for 3 individuals. 
#Perform a principal component analysis on the numerical columns of this data. 
#How many components do we need to get 85% of the variation in the data set?

#Do we need to normalize these columns or not?
#Is the "total" column really the total of the values in the other columns?

#Should we have included in the PCA? What do you expect about the largest principal components and the total column? Remember, a given principal component corresponds to a weighted combination of the original variables.
#Make a plot of the two largest components. Any insights?
